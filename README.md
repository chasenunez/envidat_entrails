# EnviDat Entrails for Exploring & Visualizing the data types on Envidat

This toolkit does three main things:

1. **Downloads metadata listings** from several S3-compatible endpoints.  
2. **Aggregates file details** (like name, extension, and size) into a unified CSV (`all_s3_files.csv`).  
3. **Visualizes the results** with interactive charts using Plotly.

You’ll get:
- Sankey diagrams for file-type distributions (by count *and* by size)
- Sunburst charts showing bucket and extension hierarchies (also by count *and* by size)
- A CSV summary for further analysis

## Buckets Analyzed

These are the five S3 endpoints we’re working with:

| Bucket | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `envidat-doi` | Published EnviDat datasets with DOIs |
| `envicloud` | Internal EnviDat staging and mirrored datasets |
| `chelsav1` | CHELSA climate dataset (v1) |
| `chelsav2` | CHELSA climate dataset (v2) |
| `edna` | Elevation-derived hydrological data |
| `others` | We can add other S3 buckets later |

Each bucket is public on the SWITCH Cloud (`https://os.zhdk.cloud.switch.ch/<bucket-name>/`).


## Script Overview

**Typical run:**

```bash
#pull s3 file data
python3 entrails.py fetch --out all_s3_files.csv      

#visualize the data
python3 entrails.py visualize --csv all_s3_files.csv --out-prefix envidat_viz

#or do both
python envidat_filetype_tool.py run-all --out all_s3_files.csv --out-prefix envidat_viz
```

**Outputs:**

* `all_s3_files.csv` - or whatever you call it in your CLI, a csv that holds all the file data scraped from the online buckets
* `out_sankey.html` — File type breakdown by **count**
* `out_sankey_size.html` — File type breakdown by **total bytes**
* `out_sunburst.html` — Hierarchical breakdown (bucket → extension) by **count**
* `out_sunburst_size.html` — Hierarchical breakdown (bucket → extension) by **total bytes**

## Visual Examples

| Visualization        | Description                                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sankey (count)**   | Shows how many files of each type exist across all buckets.   |
| **Sankey (bytes)**   | Shows which file types are hogging the most disk space.       |
| **Sunburst (count)** | Visualizes the bucket→file-type hierarchy by number of files. |
| **Sunburst (bytes)** | Same hierarchy, but sized by total data volume (bytes).       |

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* `pandas`
* `plotly`
* `boto3`
* `tqdm`
* `requests`
* (Optional) `humanfriendly` for nicer byte-size logs

## Byte-Size Reality Checks

Ever see numbers like `34782943827` and think “uh, what”?
Use the built-in `human_bytes()` helper to print totals in GiB or TiB:

```python
from visualize_s3_data import human_bytes
print(human_bytes(34782943827))  # 32.4GiB
```

Because nobody wants to count bytes manually.

## Troubleshooting

**Q:** “I got an Access Denied error.”
**A:** Some buckets or objects might be private. The script skips those gracefully.

**Q:** “My sunburst looks weird.”
**A:** Make sure the CSV includes valid `bucket_name` and `extension` columns. Use `process_s3_data.py` to regenerate a clean one.

**Q:** “The Sankey is all gray.”
**A:** That’s Plotly’s default. Try toggling to ‘Dark Mode’ in your browser and pretend it’s a design choice.
